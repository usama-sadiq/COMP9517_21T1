# COMP9517 COMPUTER VISION PROJECT SELF DRIVING CAR

# AIM

- Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in autonomous or self-driving technology. New car models combine a variety of sensors such as radar, lidar, and GPS to better perceive their surroundings. Advanced control systems, artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies interpret sensory information to identify obstacles and enable vehicles to steer themselves on existing roads and navigate many types of environmental conditions with almost no direct human assistance. In this project, you will develop a simple 
visual perception module for a self-driving car.

# OBJECTIVE

- The project is aimed at the application of computer vision techniques learned in this course. An image-based approach, using the output of an on-board camera, will be developed to recognise vehicles, estimate distance and velocities and finally, detect driving lanes.

# LEARNING OUTCOME

- After completing this project, you would have built a practical computer vision application that draws upon all the topics taught in this course. You will also learn how to work individually and with a group.
